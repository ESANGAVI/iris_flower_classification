**Iris Flower Classification**

This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using Logistic Regression, SVC, and Random Forest. Performance is measured using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, PCA visualization, and ROC curves. This project demonstrates end-to-end supervised learning and model comparison.

**Features**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Models: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations: PCA scatter plot, ROC Curve

**Tech Stack**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
2. Run the script or notebook  
3. Execute all steps to train and test the model

**Result**
The model accurately classifies Iris species and provides clear visual insights into class separation.
